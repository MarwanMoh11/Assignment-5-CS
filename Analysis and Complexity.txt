Heap Operations:
Both buildheapMax and buildheapMin functions have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the data being inputted. This is beacause Heapify is taking O(logn) time and we have n/2 nodes in the heap.

For getting the top increase and decrease each operation needs heapify to perform the removals from the heap N times. And Heapify algorithm has a complexity of O(logn). Hence the time comlpexity is O(Nlogn).

findMaxSubsequenceSum function iterates through the data once to calculate the cumulative sum. The time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the data inputted.

Adding all the complexities up we get a total time complexity of O(n+Nlogn) where n is the size of data and N is the number given by the user for top increasing or decreasing. 

The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of the unput data.

Note: The calculations of the mean could be done more efficiently to avoid rudendancy.
